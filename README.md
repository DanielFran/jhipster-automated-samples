JHipster automated samples
==========================

This project is for generating the JHipster sample projects, and have the continuous integration automatically test them.

- The sample projects must be cloned with the `clone_samples.sh` script in a subdirectory
- Then each project is updated with the `generate_projects.sh` script

More information, as well as the result of those tests, are available on our [build status page](https://jhipster.github.io/build_status.html).
